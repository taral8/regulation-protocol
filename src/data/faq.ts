    question: "Is this just meditation?",
    answer:
      "No. Meditation is one tool. Regulation is the foundation. This is about stabilizing your nervous system so identity change becomes possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "I've done Dr. Joe / therapy. Will this still help?",
    answer:
      "Yes — especially if you understand the concepts but struggle to embody them. This work focuses on nervous system mastery, not information.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast will I see change?",
    answer:
      "You can feel shifts quickly, but lasting identity change comes from building a stable baseline over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you teach spirituality?",
    answer:
      "Yes — but it's regulated and embodied. Science and spirituality are integrated without bypassing.",
  },

    question: "How long is a typical coaching engagement?",
    answer:
      "Both the 1:1 and group programs run for 3 months. The nervous system needs time to build new patterns — this isn't about quick fixes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens in a coaching session?",
    answer:
      "Sessions combine nervous system education, guided regulation practices, identity work, and practical integration strategies. You also get support between sessions.",
  },
  {
    question: "I've already done therapy / breathwork. How is this different?",
    answer:
      "Therapy often works at the cognitive level, breathwork at the physiological level. The Regulation Protocol bridges both: it teaches your nervous system to shift out of survival mode so that all the work you've already done can finally integrate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a payment plan?",
    answer:
      "Payment details are discussed on your application call. We work with you to find an arrangement that fits.",
